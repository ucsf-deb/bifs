"""
This module defines Exception classes to indicate errors or warnings and functions to
install global handlers for those exceptions.  Global handlers are important since
exceptions may be raised from code executing inside the Qt event loop.

If used from a Qt program pops up a message box with exception info.  
Perhaps too much info (full traceback)

Exceptions are also logged to sys.stdout.

Exceptions
----------
All classes are subclasses of BifsException.  But note the code may raise other kinds of
exceptions.   BifsFatal is a base class for exceptions that should terminate the program, and they
always include an error code with which to terminate.  Other exceptions will typically function
as notifications.

Logging
-------

Goes to a logger named "Bifs".

Useage
------

In your main program
====================
import bifs.bifsexception
# will activate the error handlers
# if you need to use the exceptions or the log, use the patterns below instead.

Other modules
=============
from bifs.bifsexception import *
# and then raise any of the exceptions
# if you need to log something
import logging
log = logging.getLogger("Bifs")

GUI Wrapper for Errors
=======================
To avoid silent failures when running in a GUI, we want to catch all Exceptions and pop up
a  window with the relevant information.  Errors are also logged to the console.

Somewhat unfortunately, there are 2 mechanisms for doing this.

First, this module puts a hook in the global exception handler; this should catch everything.
However, an exception that makes it to that hook has already failed out of the main event
loop of the application.  Python's exception semantics means the app has failed and can't be
resumed.

To avoid that, we also define a function wrapper `@catcher` that goes around individual functions.
This catches errors while inside the event loop, allowing the user to decide
whether to continue with the application.  Use it like this:

@catcher
def myfunction(self):

The function wrapped must take a single argument only; typically it is a class method with `self` as 
the only argument.  The function must not return a value.

Why the restrictions on the function to be wrapped?
  No return value: The exception means the function didn't complete, and the exception handler
    doesn't know what return value(s) would be appropriate.  So it doesn't make sense to use it
    when a value needs to be returned.
  Single argument only: The anticipated use if for QtActions implemented as methods with only
    self as an argument (and no return value).
  Single argument only: There is a technical limitation in functools.wraps; consider
  ```python
  def mywrapper(fn):
    @wraps(fn)
    def _wrapper(*args, **kwds):
        return fn(*args, **kwds)
    return _wrapper

  class Foo:
    @mywrapper
    def bar(self):
        # do stuff
  ```
  `Foo.bar` will appear to have the signature `*args, **kwds` despite the fact that the original
  bar had only the argument `self` and `@wraps` is advertised as preserving the characteristics
  of the original function.  This means, in particular, that Qt will send 2 arguments to the
  wrapped function, which will cause an error when `fn(*args, **kwds)` attempts to invoke the original `bar`.

  The decorator package, in particular its decorator member, supposedly does a better job preserving the original
  signature.  But after reading https://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/master/docs/documentation.md a few times
  I still wasn't sure how it was to be used.  Since it's an extra dependency, and since my needs seem to
  all be met with the single argument case, I just solved that problem.  RB


Implementation Note
-------------------
Python's import machinery should assure the code here is executed only once even if multiple
modules import this module.  For that to work you must use `import` rather than other strategies to access
the code.

Future Directions
-----------------
* ability to suppress traceback in dialog box
* separate the general and GUI-specific parts
* more use of logging
