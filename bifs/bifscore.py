## The filename is bifscore, not bifs or BIFS to avoid trouble
## with the import machinery.  In particular, import bifs, at
## least when executed in this directory, could import bifs.py 
## (old name for this file) rather than the package.  And thus
## from bifs.priors would fail with an error that bifs was not 
## a package.

    Class BIFS for performing Bayesian image restoration
    in k-space

    Variables
    ---------

    In the next group, clients should always use the accessor functions listed:

    init_image() - initial loaded image
    k_image() - initial k-space image
    mod_image() - initial modulus image in k-space
    phase_image() - initial phase image in k-space
    bifsk_image() - final BIFS modulus image in k-space
    final_image() - final reconstructed image in image space

    NOTE: We're keeping all these images in the BIFS object for
    now re. testing and experimentation - might be useful to 
    eventually have production run options that are more
    parsimonius re. storage.

    image_file_loaded - whether an image is loaded (True,False)
    initial_image_file_name - file name of initial image
    imdim - int image dimension (1,2 or 3)

    kdist() = distance on the shifted k-space lattice

    view3Dslice - for 3D data this is a 2D array [a,b] where:
                  a = axis perpindicular to slice
                  b = fraction of maximum along that direction 
                      for slice location
    
    prior - string specifying prior distribution to use
            current choices:
            'Gaussian'

    prior_choices - list of current prior choices (see above)
    prior_scale - the overall scale of the prior variance
    prior_scale_orig - prior scale at the origin - generally set huge
                           to allow data to determine overall scale

    All of the above prior* variables are obsolescent.  Prefer the new
    _prior  - <AbstractPrior>

    The next 2 items might be obsolescent.  However, their presence permits us to
    set the parameter type before the image is loaded; _prior needs image info,
    specifically dimensions, for construction.
    param_func_type is replaced by _prior, specifically _prior.name(), 
    and param_func_choices should come from import priors
    param_func_type - string specifying the k-space BIFS paramter
                      function to use
                      current choices:
                      "Inverse Power Decay"
                      "Banded Inverse Power Decay"
                      "Linear Decay"
                      "Empirical"
    param_func_choices - list of current choices (see above)


    likelihood - string specifying likelihood distribution to use
                 current choices:
                 'Gaussian'
                 'Rician'

    likelihood_choices - list of current choices (see above)
    likelihood_scale - the assumed (const) noise level in k-space

    bessel_approx_lims - limits for bessel approximtion for rice
                         distribution - see paper referenced in code

    bessel_approx_array - array for bessel approximtion for rice
                         distribution - see paper referenced in code
    
    rice_denom_cutoff - cutoff for the demoninator of the closed form 
                        of the posterior with a Gaussian prior and
                        Rician likelihood derived from bessel approximation
                        see paper referenced in code

    basis - string specifying the basis to use - currently ony choice
            is "Fourier"
    basis_choices - list of current choices (see above)

    We continue to use bumps, but they mostly live in the prior.  We retain some info 
    here for compatibility with the GUI.

    bumps - dictionary containing set of "bump" filters to implement
    bump_types - set of choices for "bump" filter types to add to k-space
                 paramter function; uses scipy.signal window types 
                 so consult that documentation for available types - 
                 currently only types that only require window type name
                 and size are used - current choices are: 
                 "boxcar"
                 "blackman"
                 "hann"
                 "bartlett"
                 "flattop"
                 "parzen"
                 "bohman"
                 "blackmanharris"
                 "nuttall"
                 "barthann"
    bump_default_type - the default window type used (currently "blackman")
