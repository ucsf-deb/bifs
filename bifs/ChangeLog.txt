* 0.9.4 2022-01-06 Ross Boylan <ross.boylan@ucsf.edu>
  * Improved handling of sequence-dependent operations
    E.g., don't show commands in the GUI that require a loaded image til one is loaded.
  * Updates for changing code in support libraries.
    + np.intp not np.int for indices
    + float not np.float
    + matplotlib will ignore keyword arguments to gca(projection='3d').
      Unsure about the "fix"; flagged in Issue #29.
  * Fix Issue #24: error on exit from File | Quit
  * Develop exception handling and logging
  * Catch exceptions and display them graphically in bifs_gui.py
  * Avoid print to sys.stdout for GUI friendliness
  * Above changes address much of Issue #21, put the GUI in bifs_gui.
    However, some output continues to go to the terminal.  This is mostly
    in functions that need an overhaul or removal.
  * Updated examples to work with current code.
  * bifs_cl_3D.py still does not work, and it's unclear what it should do.
    Opened Issue #28 about it.  Issue #29 also related.
  * Remove more references to uniform prior and add comments explaining its absence,
    closes Issue #4 (should have been closed earlier).
  * Create this ChangeLog file.
